# Biprop - A Python Library for Calculating Biproportional Apportionments

> [!CAUTION]
> DO NOT use this repository to calculate the official results of actual elections! The code in this repository was not formally verified and might not always deliver correct results or terminate.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that version 0.x.x of `biprop.py` is still experimental. I am currently working on a more mature and user-friendly version of `biprop.py` that will not be backwards compatible with version 0.x.x.

Welcome to the the biprop repository. This repository is meant for election enthusiats and statistics nerds like me who want to ask questions like
> How would the parliament of country X look like if they used biproportional apportionment in their last election?

or
> How would the apportionment change if party Y and Z ran together as one and if we introduced a quorum that parties have to fulfill?
> 
The repository includes the `biprop.py` module which contains all the relevant functions to answer questions like the ones above. It also contains an `example.py` module that uses the 2019 and 2023 Swiss National Council Elections to demonstrate how to use `biprop.py`.
